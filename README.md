The Pinboard Ruby Gem
=====================
A Ruby wrapper for the [Pinboard API](http://pinboard.in/api/).

Installation
------------
    gem install pinboard

Examples
--------

I'm currently exploring two API interfaces:

```ruby
    pinboard = Pinboard::Client.new(:username => 'foo', :password => 'bar')
    posts = pinboard.posts
```
or:

```ruby
    posts = Pinboard::Post.all(:username => 'foo', :password => 'bar')
```
Both examples work.

Passing arguments: (works only for the Client API Interface)

```ruby
	pinboard.posts(:tag => 'ruby') #all posts tagged 'ruby'
	pinboard.posts(:tag => 'ruby,pinboard') #all posts tagged 'ruby' and 'pinboard'
    pinboard.posts(:start => 20) #starting on the 20th post
    pinboard.posts(:results => 20) #return only first 20 matching posts
    pinboard.posts(:fromdt => 4.days.ago) #all posts in past 4 days
    pinboard.posts(:todt => 4.days.ago) #all posts up to 4 days ago
```

Future Examples (I don't need them, so I haven't written them)
--------------------------------------------------------------

    pinboard.posts(:meta => true) #include meta data in post models
